# Impossible Wordsearch
Impossible Wordsearch is a shiny app for building wordsearches of custom dimension and content. 

# TODO list (immediate)

- Configure gameplay
  a. incorporate board refresher logic
  b. adaptive game logic + radio button toggle
  c. (stretch goal) incorporate "none of these are correct" button for really hard modes (% occurrence as toggle)
  d. (stretch goal) instead of one board, sequence of boards that gets easier over time
- Write the readme
- a. Explain the logic of how the word searches get built
- b. The rules of the game
- c. Intended applications (build upon the hypernormalization example, its crowd knowledge)
- d. add a toggle for mobile dimensions/4k dimensions

# Ideas for iteration:
- instead of making one board, make a sequence of boards that reveal over time the positin
